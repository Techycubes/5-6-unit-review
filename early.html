        <h2>His Early Life</h2>

        <p>
            Tengen was born into a family of shinobi, where he was one of nine siblings. His upbringing was harsh <br>
            and rooted in his fatherâ€™s demanding and ruthless philosophy, which treated the lives of his children as <br>
            expendable in pursuit of power. This brutal environment led to the death of most of his siblings, <br>
            leaving only Tengen and a brother. While his brother embraced their father's ideology, Tengen rejected it, <br>
             becoming disillusioned with the cruel values instilled in him. This rebellion against his upbringing shaped his moral compass, <br>
             compelling him to value life and protect others rather than treat them as tools.
