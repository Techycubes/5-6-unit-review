        <p>
            Tengen eventually joined the Demon Slayer Corps, where he was trained to become a Hashira. His unique fighting style, <br>
            centered around sound and inspired by his shinobi background, set him apart. Using his heightened sense of hearing, <br>
            he developed a technique called Sound Breathing, which allows him to analyze and anticipate his opponents' movements. <br>
As the Sound Hashira, Tengen was instrumental in numerous missions. His expertise was most prominently displayed during the Entertainment District Arc, <br>
 where he led the battle against the Upper Rank Six demons, Daki and Gyutaro. Despite being severely injured and poisoned, <br>
 Tengen showcased his immense strength, agility, and tactical ingenuity, ultimately contributing to the defeat of the powerful demon duo. <br>
Following the intense battle, Tengen retired from active duty due to his injuries. Despite stepping down, <br>
his influence remained strong within the Corps, and he continued to provide guidance and support when needed.
