<p>Tengen Uzui is a prominent character in the Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba series, serving as the Sound Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps. Known for his flamboyant personality and striking appearance, Tengen is characterized by his muscular build, brightly colored attire, and a headband adorned with gemstones. <br>
     He is a skilled swordsman, wielding dual Nichirin cleavers connected by a chain, and incorporates sound-based techniques <br>
     into his combat style, using his heightened sense of hearing to anticipate enemy moves. <br>
    Tengen values "flashiness" and believes in living life vibrantly, a philosophy reflected in his dramatic demeanor. Despite his bold personality, he has a deep sense of responsibility and loyalty, particularly toward his three wives—Makio, Suma, and Hinatsuru—whom he treasures deeply. His backstory reveals a complex past as a shinobi, where he endured a harsh upbringing that shaped his values and strong sense of justice.</p>
