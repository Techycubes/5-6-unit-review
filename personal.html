            Tengen’s personal life is as vibrant as his personality. He is married to three wives—Makio, Suma, <br>
            and Hinatsuru—whom he cherishes deeply. Unlike his upbringing, Tengen fosters a relationship with his wives <br>
            based on mutual respect, love, and trust. They are also skilled kunoichi who actively assist him during missions,<br>
             embodying the teamwork and solidarity of their bond. <br>

Tengen’s flamboyant demeanor often masks his more thoughtful and compassionate nature. <br>He is deeply committed to protecting innocent lives and ensuring that his loved ones are safe and happy. His personal philosophy emphasizes living life to its fullest, a reflection of his resolve to rise above the darkness of his past and embrace a brighter, more meaningful future.
